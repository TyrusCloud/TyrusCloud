## About Me

I am a cleared cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in Linux systems, security monitoring, and log analysis. My focus is on Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows, including authentication monitoring, system and application logging, and SIEM-based detection.

I am currently building practical SOC and cloud-security-aligned labs to strengthen my skills in security monitoring, incident detection, and secure cloud environments, with a long-term goal of transitioning into Cloud Security Engineering within the government and defense sector.
